    "summary" : "Rebelution has released their 6th studio album Free Rein (87 Music/Easy Star Records). The 12 tracks on the LP fuse Rebelution’s classic reggae sound with genres spanning R&B, rock, jazz and folk; this is Rebelution’s most diverse album to date. The collection of songs shines a spotlight on the band’s evocative songwriting, incendiary playing and timely lyrical commentary. The bold move from the powerhouse band proves their artistry and experimental prowess, though their signature laidback Summery reggae sound still shines through (thanks in part to collaborations with acclaimed Jamaican producers Don Corleon [Rihanna, Sean Paul] and Winta James [Damian Marley, Chronixx]).",
